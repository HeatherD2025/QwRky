Use async to demonstrate ES Module improvement over common js
lazy load on scrolling for pics and news apps, comments, etc
allow users to like articles, save articles 

look into using httpOnly cookies instead of localStorage (not required, but recommended in sensitive apps)

Use a refresh token rotation strategy on the backend if not already

logout logic - remember to clear server side and redux as fallback:

const [logoutUser] = useLogoutMutation();
const dispatch = useDispatch();

const handleLogout = async () => {
  await logoutUser();   
  dispatch(logout());       
}
